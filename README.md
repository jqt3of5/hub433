Inspired by my interest in IoT, and my newly finished backyard. I wanted to design a system that would allow me to control low voltage lighting, remotely through the web. 

This project has seen a number of iterations, each trying to control a unique set of devices. This iteration is by far the simplest. The other projects ended up overly complicated
and I designed myself into an architectural corner.
